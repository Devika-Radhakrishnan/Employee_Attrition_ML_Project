# Employee_Attrition_ML_Project
This repository contains code and analysis for predicting employee attrition using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and focuses on various features related to employees in a company.

#Dataset
The dataset includes information such as employee satisfaction, performance, work environment, and other relevant factors. The goal is to build and compare machine learning models to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (attrition).

#Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms have been implemented and compared in this project:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method for classification that predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. In this context, it is used for binary classification to predict employee attrition.

Decision Tree: A tree-like model where the data is split into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node. It is a popular choice for classification tasks.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes as the prediction.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem that assumes independence between features. It's often used for classification tasks
